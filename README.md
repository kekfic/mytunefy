# This is MyTuneFy
Playling, downloading and streaming your music (spotify and youtube).
Player developed with vlc, spotify download with spotdl, youtube with youtube dl and pafy.
A sqlite database is created for saving songs downloaded, position, filename

I developed this program to improve my python programming skills.
This program is based on already existing library (that actually made the
tougher part of the job).
Contributions are very much appreciated!

* Tested on Python 3.6
## Note
spotify id and secret key are needed ----> in resources.resources
